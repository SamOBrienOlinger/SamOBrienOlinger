Hi, I'm Sam.

![ProfilePic](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzhbg6go0/image/upload/v1692011747/AtASlant_lno4wp.jpg)

Welcome to my Github, and thank you for taking the time to visit.  

I have A LOT of repositories here, the majority are in development for playing with and learning purposes. 

If you don't have the time to sift through them all to find the best representations of my abilities, may I suggest checking out these projects ðŸ™‚:

## A little bit about me

  I am very pleased to say that I have completed Code Institute's Diploma in Full Stack Software Development, and was awarded a Merit for 2 of my projects. [Cockapoo Club](https://home-cockapoo-club-pp4.herokuapp.com/) is one example. 
  
  I'm really excited about what the future holds for me, especially because Full Stack Developement is a relatively new area and industry for me. 
  
  My previous career path provided me with international and domestic professional experience and expertise in the folowing areas:

  - Diversity & Inclusion
  - Policing  
  - Community Development
  - Education
  - European Union funded projects
  - Public Policy
  - Social Research
  - Communications

  - Developing and managing a platform with national scope called *One Step Up*

For a bit more of an insight into my professional background, below are some examples of publications that I was either the author or a co-author:

- [*Routledge International Handbook of Police Ethnography*](https://www.routledge.com/Routledge-International-Handbook-of-Police-Ethnography/Fleming-Charman/p/book/9780367539399?utm_medium=email&utm_source=EmailStudio%25%25__AdditionalEmailAttribute4%25%25&utm_campaign=B190608179_4539656%25%25__AdditionalEmailAttribute1%25%25) (Chapter 34)
- [*Police, Race and Culture in the â€˜New Irelandâ€™*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1057/9781137490452)
- [*Submission to the Department of Children, Equality,Disability, Integration and Youthâ€™s public consultations to review the Equality Acts*](https://www.aontas.com/assets/resources/Submissions/Equality%20Acts%20Consultation%20Paper_AONTAS%202021.docx.pdf)
- [*Submission for the National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2022-2026*](https://www.aontas.com/assets/resources/Submissions/AONTAS%20Submission_NAP%202022-2026.pdf)
- [*Educational Equality is Central to Ireland's Recovery: Community Education in a Time of COVID-19*](https://www.aontas.com/assets/resources/CEN%20Census/CEN%20Census%20Policy%20Paper.pdf)
- [*Lifelong learning and the odd puncture*](https://www.ageaction.ie/sites/default/files/attachments/third_and_final_proof.pdf)
- [*Elder Abuse Context and Theory: Finland, Ireland, Italy and Romania*](http://www.combatingelderabuse.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Booklet_stage.pdf)
- [*Age Action Intercultural Care Home Project Report*](https://www.ageaction.ie/sites/default/files/23626-Age%20Action%20Inter-Cultural%20Report-LR4.pdf)
- [*Value for Money and Policy Review of Youth Programmes*](http://www.drugsandalcohol.ie/23242/1/ValueforMoneyYouthProjects.pdf)
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

For me anyway, one of the most interesting and positive aspects of making the move to Software Development has been finding out how much I enjoy each stage involved in the process of delivering a high-quality product. 

The mindset, creativity and discipline required to perform the trapeze act Developers do every day in order to balance Form and Function just fascinates me. I very much hope to be able to walk that tightrope myself for a long time to come.
