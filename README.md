Hi, I'm Sam. Welcome to my Github, and thank you for taking the time to visit. 
![ProfilePic](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzhbg6go0/image/upload/v1692011747/AtASlant_lno4wp.jpg)

For me anyway, some of the most interesting and exciting aspects of choosing to make a career change to Software Development is 

   [:smile:] Finding out how much I enjoy learning about and practicing each stage involved in the process of delivering high-quality products. 

   [:smile:] The mindset, creativity and discipline required to perform the trapeze act Developers do every day in order to balance Form and Function just fascinates me.

I very much look forward to walking that tightrope with my teammates in a great organiszation far into the future.

## A little bit about me

  I am very pleased to say that I have completed Code Institute's Diploma in Full Stack Software Development, and was awarded Merits for 2 of my projects. [Cockapoo Club](https://home-cockapoo-club-pp4.herokuapp.com/), listed above is one example. 
  
  I'm really excited about what the future holds for me, especially because I am still learning so much about specific languages and technologies, but also about the scale and variety of roles within Software Development and the tech industry as a whole.
